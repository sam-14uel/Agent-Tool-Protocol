## **[0.1.9] - 2025-10-03**

### Added
- **OAuth2 Integration & Token Handling**:  
  - Introduced `LLMClient.initiate_oauth_connection()` to start OAuth2 flows and generate authorization URLs.  
  - Added `LLMClient.wait_for_connection()` to poll and retrieve integration IDs after user authorization.  
  - Added `LLMClient.get_user_tokens()` to securely fetch user access and refresh tokens.  
  - Tokens are now automatically injected into tool calls, reducing boilerplate for developers.  
  - Documentation includes usage example for HubSpot, Google, Salesforce, and other third-party tools.



## **[0.1.7] - 2025-09-21**

### Added
- **Framework Integrations**:  
  - **Django**: `django_atp` app for seamless integration.  
    - Exposes each registered tool at `/atp/<toolkit_name>/<tool_name>/` (GET for metadata, POST for execution).  
    - Admin-friendly registration via `register_client()`.  
  - **FastAPI**: `fastapi_atp` registry with example endpoints for instant ATP routing.  
  - **Flask**: `flask_atp` registry and lightweight endpoints for quick adoption.
- **ToolKit Client Registration**:  
  - Introduced `register_client(<name>, <ToolKitClient>)` for explicit toolkit registration.
  - Eliminates the need to call `ToolKitClient.start()`.
- **API Marketplace Pattern**: Functions can now be instantly exposed as ATP-compatible HTTP endpoints across frameworks.
- **Cross-Framework Schema Consistency**: Unified protocol so that ChatATP and other ATP clients can call any registered tool without code changes.
- **Documentation Upgrade**:  
  - Added complete integration guides for Django, FastAPI, and Flask.
  - Included ready-to-copy code samples with curl examples.

### Changed
- **Refactored Startup Flow**: Removed mandatory `.start()` call; registration occurs at import time.
- **Cleaner Registry APIs**: Standardized `get_client()` lookup across Django, FastAPI, and Flask registries.
- **Improved Dependency Management**: Added optional extras (`django`, `fastapi`, `flask`) for targeted installs.

### Fixed
- **Endpoint Stability**: Ensured predictable JSON responses for both GET (tool metadata) and POST (execution) calls.
- **Import Order Issues**: Tools registered in app `ready()` now load reliably at server startup.

## **[0.1.5] - 2025-08-23**

### Added
- **Enhanced `pyproject.toml`**: Updated metadata, classifiers, and dependencies for better PyPI compatibility.
- **Improved Documentation**: Added detailed request/response flow in the README.
- **Support for Multi-Step Tool Calls**: Clarified how to loop through tool calls from LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral).

### Changed
- **Version Bump**: Updated to `0.1.5`.
- **Dependencies**: Specified minimum versions for `requests` and `websocket-client`.

### Fixed
- **Package Inclusion**: Ensured `atp_sdk` and its submodules are correctly included in the build.
